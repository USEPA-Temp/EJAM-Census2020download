Description: This package has basic functions for downloading from FTP, 
  unzipping, reading the 2020 Census data for some or all US States 
  into a single data.frame. It provides a dataset of all US blocks
  with a few key variables like population count, lat/lon of internal point, 
  FIPS.
  (It downloads and also could retain some other columns like 
  area, and some basic race ethnicity counts,
  with small changes to some source code).
